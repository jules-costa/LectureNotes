##Chess

Q: Should all pieces be in one file?
A: Put them all in separate files for easy navigation.

Q: Where do the chess pieces come from in board.rb (line 100)?
A: Those are the classes that you'll make pieces from. They are begin "required" from pieces.

Q: Does pieces.rb require all the individual pieces?
A: Yes.

Q: What happens when a piece gets selected for movement?
A: High-level logic is in the game#play method, which calls player#move_piece.

Q: Is there a way to require_relative the contents of an entire directory?
A: There might be. Google it.

##Rspec

Q: Should we ask prospective employers how much they test their codebase?
A: Sure. If you do some research beforehand, you can ask more specific questions regarding testing, that will show you're interested.

Q: So, we test the public methods (not private) because people will be depending on them?
A: Yes.

Q: All of our private methods are used somewhere in public methods...So do we end up testing private methods?
A: No. You should just be testing the behavior of your code, without worrying about how it's implemented.

Q: What are other approaches to TDD?
A: I don't know if there are others that have names, but some people may write tests after they write some code.

Q: Why not just write great code in the first place and not have to refactor?
A: If you write perfect code, good for you! The most optimal solution is often the most complicated...Aim for solutions first, then make them more elegant/efficient.

Q: Is Cucumber something you should learn later? Is it more common?
A: I've never used it, so I can't give the best advice on that...I'd recommend learning front-end testing first.

##Rspec Demo

Q: Is this in Celsius?
A: That would be some very hot food. Hahaha.

Q: What is the scope of a subject / let?
A: It is the entire describe block.

Q: Should you write all descriptions then fill them in?
A: It's a stylistic choice.

Q: Since all of these tests can access the subject, why do you have this before_each block?
A: You're right, it's unnecessary!

Q: Does before take things other than each?
A: You can do before_all, and there might be others. Check the docs.

Q: Expect vs. should?
A: Should is outdated and deprecated. Don't write it, but know you may encounter it in the wild.

Q: Is a double just a simple object with a few attributes?
A: Yes. Exactly.

Q: String vs. symbols in "let"?
A: Either will work fine.

Q: Can you elaborate on calling methods within tests?
A: When you call a method on an object, the object is the receiver of that method. You must expect something to happen, and then make it happen in order for the test to pass.

Q: Why do we have separate eat and consume methods?
A: They are written for different classes.

Q: When do we make new context?
A: I want to do something that will affect all tests underneath the context. Think about what will make the most sense if someone if reading this as documentation or your program.

##Homework

Q: Why is the Chef class there?
A: The idea is that the Dessert class would in reality, work together with the Chef class. You could look at the Chef class to learn how its double should behave in your tests.

Q: What's require active/support?
A: It's for the pluralize method on line 33. You'll see more of this when you learn Rails.

Q: How do we test ingredients.shuffle? (line 20)
A: Just test the behavior of the code, not the implementation.

##Quiz

Q: Is there a rule for {} vs () ?
A: Use a block when raising an error, parens when you want to return something.
